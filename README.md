# MzkWorldMap

This project's main goal is to simulate a 3D Earth, on which one can browse the planet to discovery music from all over the world.
This ThreeJS bedrock is the core of the MzkWorldMap plugin, since this projet require a track database to perform well. 

However, one can still use it standalone with sample data to try it out. Check out the wiki page to know more about data formatting for MzkWorldMap. 
Coming Milestones can be found on the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/ONoFwDyj/MzkWorldMap).
